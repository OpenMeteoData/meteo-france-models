## Introduction

Welcome to the **MÃ©tÃ©o-France models on AWS** project.

This project is brought to you by [OpenMeteoData](https://openmeteodata.com) and [AWS Public Dataset Program](https://aws.amazon.com/opendata/public-datasets/).

**We serve MÃ©tÃ©o-France models data from high-performance and reliable [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) hosting service.**

## Why

In July of 2015, MÃ©tÃ©o-France (MF) did open access to a part of it's Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models data.
This was a real breaktrough.

Since then, the data is officialy disseminated through MF data portal <https://donneespubliques.meteofrance.fr/>

Unfortunately, the official MF data portal is not keeping up with the load. Users are reporting issues getting the data in a timely and reliable manner. This prevents the use of MF data on a large scale. [See testimonials](issue-testimonials.md).

We do think that MF models data are high-quality and high-interests datasets.

**We do support MF efforts to make it's data public, and want to bring our help to disseminate and enable reuse of the data in an efficient and easy way.**

That is why we developped this service enabling easy access to MF models data.

## Licence

**Both original and new data are Licensed under [French Government Open Licence](license.md)**

Our work is based on open-data from MÃ©tÃ©o-France, but we are not affiliated or endorsed by MÃ©tÃ©o-France by any way.

## Availability and SLA

We aim to provide a service with industry-grade reliability.

**HOWEVER THIS SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON A BEST EFFORT BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARANTEE. IT MAY BE SUBJECT TO OUTAGES WITHOUT PRIOR NOTIFICATION.**

Our systems are fully monitored with immediate email and SMS alert in case of a problem.

We are still dependent on Meteo-France servers. So if Meteo-France servers go down, there is nothing we can do. However, you will also face this problem if you download the data directly from Meteo-France servers.

**On request, we can provide commercial SLA** (including access to premium Meteo-France servers). Pricing starts at â‚¬500 / month. Email contact@openmeteodata.com for more informations.

Documentation for Météo-France models on AWS





# Deprecation notice!

This service will be permanently shut down on December 9, 2024.

For years, I have advocated for Météo-France data to be hosted on the data.gouv.fr platform rather than internally.

Under my initiative, Météo-France and data.gouv.fr joined forces. Their collaboration resulted in the creation of the meteo.data.gouv.fr platform.

You must now go to meteo.data.gouv.fr to download the data.

The files are not exactly the same, so you may need to make some technical adjustments. Don't delay your migration.

My service was a temporary solution to relieve Météo-France's internal infrastructure. Therefore, it is no longer necessary.
